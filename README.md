## 🌐 Network+ (N10-009) Overview

Network+ serves as the core networking certification to bridge from general IT knowledge to more advanced cybersecurity concepts. This section of the repo will house structured labs, diagrams, Wireshark captures, and written deliverables demonstrating real networking skills.

### **Primary Objectives**
Deepen understanding of:
- Network architectures (LAN/WAN, SOHO, enterprise)  
- Routing & switching  
- TCP/IP stack  
- Subnetting & IP addressing  
- VLANs, trunking, STP, link aggregation  
- DHCP, DNS, NTP, and directory services  
- Wireless standards & security  
- Network monitoring & packet inspection  
- IPv4/IPv6 configuration and troubleshooting  

Build hands-on labs involving:
- Multi-VM topologies  
- Packet Tracer simulations  
- Wireshark protocol analysis  
- Routing tables & static routes  
- DHCP/DNS server configuration  
- VLAN segmentation scenarios  

Create diagrams and deliverables suitable for professional portfolio use.

### **Outcome**
Upon completing the Network+ track:
- You will have a strong networking baseline suitable for cybersecurity work  
- The GitHub repo will contain multi-layer labs showing real technical capability  
- You will be prepared to begin Security+, which builds directly on these concepts

## 🔐 Security+ (SY0-701) Overview

Security+ formalizes the cybersecurity fundamentals required for SOC, help desk security roles, analyst roles, and IT roles with a security focus. This section of the repo will document security labs that show hands-on competency.

### **Primary Objectives**
Master the core SY0-701 domains:
- Threats, Vulnerabilities & Mitigations  
- Security Operations & Monitoring  
- Architecture & Design  
- Implementation  
- Governance, Risk & Compliance  

Build security-focused labs:
- Network segmentation & firewall policies  
- Traffic analysis & threat identification via Wireshark  
- Basic SIEM log review scenarios  
- Hashing, encryption demos, certificate inspection  
- Linux hardening and Windows security baselines  
- Secure network design diagrams  

Produce professional deliverables:
- Write-ups  
- Comparison charts  
- Attack-path diagrams  
- Lab reports  
- Security recommendations  

### **Outcome**
By completing the Security+ track:
- You will understand core security principles used across cybersecurity roles  
- Your repo will contain real, demonstrable security labs and reports  
- You will be prepared for SOC I, IT Security Analyst I, and general IT roles requiring security skills
