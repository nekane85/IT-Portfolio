Reinforce command-line skills (Windows + Linux)

Complete lightweight labs:

Wireshark basics

DNS lookups

Static IP assignments

Intro firewall rule testing

Build notes, diagrams, and flashcards

Upload all lab artifacts for recruiter visibility

Outcome

Strong foundational knowledge restored

VM-based lab environment validated

Repository populated with early deliverables

Prepared for full Network+ curriculum

🌐 Network+ (N10-009) Overview

Network+ serves as the core networking certification to bridge from general IT knowledge to more advanced cybersecurity concepts. This section of the repo will house structured labs, diagrams, Wireshark captures, and written deliverables demonstrating real networking skills.

Primary Objectives

Deepen understanding of:

Network architectures (LAN/WAN, SOHO, enterprise)

Routing & switching

TCP/IP stack

Subnetting & IP addressing

VLANs, trunking, STP, link aggregation

DHCP, DNS, NTP, and directory services

Wireless standards & security

Network monitoring & packet inspection

IPv4/IPv6 configuration and troubleshooting

Build hands-on labs involving:

Multi-VM topologies

Packet Tracer simulations

Wireshark protocol analysis

Routing tables & static routes

DHCP/DNS server configuration

VLAN segmentation scenarios

Create diagrams and deliverables suitable for professional portfolio use

Outcome

Upon completing the Network+ track:

You will have a strong networking baseline suitable for cybersecurity work

The GitHub repo will contain multi-layer labs showing real technical capability

You will be prepared to begin Security+, which builds directly on these concepts

🔐 Security+ (SY0-701) Overview

Security+ formalizes the cybersecurity fundamentals required for SOC, help desk security roles, analyst roles, and IT roles with a security focus. This section of the repo will document security labs that show hands-on competency.

Primary Objectives

Master the core SY0-701 domains:

Threats, Vulnerabilities & Mitigations

Security Operations & Monitoring

Architecture & Design

Implementation

Governance, Risk & Compliance

Build security-focused labs:

Network segmentation & firewall policies

Traffic analysis & threat identification via Wireshark

Basic SIEM log review scenarios

Hashing, encryption demonstrations, certificate inspection

Linux hardening and Windows security baselines

Secure network design diagrams

Produce professional deliverables:

Write-ups

Comparison charts

Attack-path diagrams

Lab reports

Security recommendations

Outcome

By completing the Security+ track:

You will understand the foundational security principles used across all cybersecurity roles

Your repository will contain real, demonstrable security labs and reports

You will be prepared for SOC I, IT Security Analyst I, and general IT roles requiring security skills
