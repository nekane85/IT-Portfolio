🔁 Ready to begin Day 1 — Networking Fundamentals & OSI Model

If you want, I can also prepare a template table for Day 1–5 progress tracking inside the README itself that uses checkmarks for each deliverable — so it will visually show completion progress on GitHub.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
okay, links that are embeded in words do not copy over to github from here. how can you rework this so links work knowing this info
ChatGPT said:

Got you — GitHub strips embedded rich-text links when copying from ChatGPT’s UI, so we must format everything in pure Markdown syntax, with no hidden embedded links, only raw Markdown text.

That means every link must be written literally like this:

[Professor Messer A+ Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL...)


Those always copy/paste perfectly into GitHub, because GitHub interprets raw Markdown.

Below is your README rewritten using only raw Markdown links (no hidden embedding).
Everything will copy/paste 1:1 into GitHub correctly.
